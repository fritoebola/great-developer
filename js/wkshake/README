WKShake

Note: this plugin relies on having access to device accelerometer via DeviceMotion API:

Usage

First, include the main JavaScript file in the header of your HTML document:

<script type="text/javascript" src="WKShake.js" ></script>

Next, include the following JavaScript just before the end </body> tag in your HTML to create a new instance of the plugin. Put your own code within the shakeEventDidOccur() method for what you want to happen when a shake event occurs.

<script type="text/javascript"> 
window.onload = function() {

	//create a new instance of WKShake.
	var myShakeEvent = new WKShake();

	//start listening for shake event. 
	//you can also use stop() to stop listening.
	myShakeEvent.start();
	
	//define a custom method to fire when shake occurs.
	myShakeEvent.shakeEventDidOccur = function() {
	
		//put your own code here etc.
		if (confirm("Undo?")) {

		}
	}
};
</script>
